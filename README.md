Innovation Challenge: Aviation (Plane Status Updates)

We plan to ease passenger worries while at the airport with a detailed, status update system. This update systems will notify the status of the flight to its corresponding passengers from the time of plane arrival at the airport until boarding time right before departure. The main progress checkmarks that we wanted to implement for the status update would be plane arrival, sanitazion, cargo loading, staff check in, and boarding time.
